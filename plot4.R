## Script for the fourth plot

# Instructions:
# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related 
# sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# Load the needed data
NEI <- readRDS("./exdata-data-NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("./exdata-data-NEI_data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# In order to find the coal related sources we look into the "EI.Sector"
# variable for the word "Coal"
library(dplyr)
SCC_coal <- SCC %>%
        select(SCC, EI.Sector) %>% # Only keep the columns we will use
        filter(grepl("Coal", EI.Sector))
        
# Merge the data with NEI keeping only the rows related with coal
NEI_coal <- merge(NEI, SCC_coal)

# Group and summarize
NEI_coal_year <- NEI_coal %>%
        group_by(year) %>%
        summarise(total_emissions = sum(Emissions))
        
# Finally the result is plotted
library(ggplot2)
